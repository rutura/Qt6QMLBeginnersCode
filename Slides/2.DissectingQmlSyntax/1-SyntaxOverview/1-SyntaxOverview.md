# Notes to self
        . A basic example to generally explore the syntax of qml
        . Main ideas :
            . QML is a declarative language
            . top down hierarchy
            . components can have children
            . components can have unique IDs
            . variables
            . property binding
            . responding to events
            . anchors to position elemetns
         . Reference the video for Qt5 if needed.
